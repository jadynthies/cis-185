# Personal Portfolio Page

# CSS external sheet
- I properly linked the css page to my html and used google fonts. I followed google fonts prompts to put the fonts into my html and css. The images I did mess up and had to lookup how to put them in properly (I forgot how to link it to my css sheet). I never finished images but was able to link it to my css and at least change their size and borders.

# Flexbox:
- Flexbox was used to house descriptions and other items. It was also attempted to be used for buttons and other organized lines.

# Grid
- Grid was supposed to be used for contact info. I put a grid in but it was mostly unused.


- **What I did**: I created a basic html template and implemented a good amount of css. But the containers confused me and I had to lookup and ask AI when my page started to look wonky. I still don't understand why my background cuts off even after playing around with css. And I fell for the 'math nightmare' Thursday's slides warned about.
- **What I failed**: I did not feel totally organized and felt the code somehow had a way of looking nicer and cleaner. There was lots of deleting and reorganizing.

## Overall

- I did not finish the project and only commited what I finished. I tried to do too many things at once, bit off more than I could chew, and as consequence I failed structure and multiple points needed to gain full credit. I am disappointed but exhausted the project, so I chose to commit what I attempted instead of restarting. I went back to the readings and previous slides from last week Thursday, and that helped tremendously. Whenever I coded something and it did not run properly or my page never changed, I would ask AI to help me check my code (it was usually css and the containers I was confused about). It helped clean up my code but mostly I had to do things from w3 and the slides.
