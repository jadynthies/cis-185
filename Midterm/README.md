## 1. Project Description
At first, I wanted to build a plant-themed trivia game website with lots of fun features, but unfortunately I'm not quite well-versed enough yet to make everything I originally imagined. So instead, I created the Botany Bud website to help new plant parents find the right plants for their homes.

## 2. Target Audience
People entering the plant hobby are often overwhelmed by the huge variety of houseplants out there, along with the care routines each one requires. Even though I didn’t add many plants, I feel like what I built is a solid start toward a helpful and informative resource for anyone trying to find plants that match the environment they live in.

## 3. Main Features
The main features of this site include the main page that gives a plant of the week, as well as a plant discovery page. The plant discovery page is where you can select what type of light you have and the level of care difficulty the user is looking for.

## 4. Technologies Used
I used basic HTML/HTML5 and CSS throughout the project. I didn’t have enough time to implement as much JavaScript as I originally hoped, but I did include some functionality where I could. I also used images sourced from online.

## 5. File Structure
I organized each .html into the html folder
style.css and any other css related goes into css
javascript into js
all readme's are on their own. This was everything felt organized and not all over the place

## 6. Challenges Faced
* I struggled with mobile and other device responsiveness, and I kept breaking my site and looking up how to fix it.
* To avoid repeating past mistakes, I stuck with a styling approach I was already familiar with from previous projects.
* With JavaScript, I had trouble implementing functions into my filters.
* I still struggle the most with CSS, and for lines like:

  ```html
  <div class="plant-card" data-light="low" data-difficulty="easy">
  ```

  I often have to look up the correct elements, attributes, and custom data attributes I need.
* I had to re-learn how to structure grids again.
* Not really a challenge, but I was weirdly excited to use HTML placeholders.


## 7. AI Tools Used
I didn’t use much of Bolt.new like we did in class. Instead, I used lovable.dev to help me get a better sense of what I wanted the website to look like and to try out ideas. However I did not use any of its actual code.
I used W3Schools to reference a lot of CSS styles and basic HTML. When I couldn’t remember or find structure of certain lines of code as well as debugging, I used ChatGPT or Copilot.
I also used ChatGPT for a lot of the writing so it would sound more professional and polished.

## 8. Future Improvements
I’d like each plant card to flip over when clicked, showing more information about the plant along with a link to its own page that covers light requirements, seasonal watering schedules, and other important notes.
I’d also like to add fun facts about each plant using JavaScript and hover effects.
The last thing I want to implement if I can is to learn how to have the website automatically update weekly for the plant of the wekk.
