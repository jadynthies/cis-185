## Code complexity comparison:
- Bootstrap was easier and faster to use, with cleaner results than writing all custom CSS. Manual design is great for going into great detail with what you want, but if you need a simple page to fill information in bootstrap works amazingly

## Development time analysis:
- Bootstrap saved a lot of time, even though I only applied it to the footer and introduction due to the deadline.

## Pros/cons of each approach:
- Manual CSS: You have full control over details but it's more time-consuming
- Bootstrap: It's fast and visually CONSISTENT (which is something I keep struggling with), but I think it's less helpful for complex layouts.


## Personal preference & reasoning:
- I prefer Bootstrap because itâ€™s easier to use, produces a good-looking layout quickly, and helps visualize the page while coding. But once I feel more confident to write css and html quickly and proficiently, I think using both would be beneficial. 

# Challenges Encountered:

- **Development time**: I fell behind due assignment 2 and it seeped into this one since I started from scratch. It took longer than expected, so while I tried to perfect other areas I did not finish bootstrap. This was another assigment that turned into a "math nightmare"

- **Aesthetic**: I feel like I prioritize placement and look over functionality which is why I keep falling behind and loosing time.

- **HTML before CSS**: I have a tendency to start css too early. I think finishing html first and forement would help avoid messy code. 

- **Material**: I am struggling to keep up with material in the class. I have two other coding classes that take up a lot of time so I'm still trying to find balance between all three. I believe this is why I have to keep looking things up and asking AI for help. I am afraid I am not understanding the material as much as I should be and will need to take another day or two just to study more on my own.
